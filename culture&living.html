                Pop culture has long served as the baton of social currency—whether you are bonding over your favourite Schitt’s Creek 
                catchphrase with a coworker on your first day at work or using the were-Ross-and-Rachel-really-on-a-break debate as an 
                icebreaker at a party. And with a global pandemic striking all outdoor activities off our social calendars, 
                it has also morphed into our preferred coping mechanism. The proof lies in the numbers—The Office, 
                a workplace mockumentary that wound up its final season almost a decade ago in 2013, clocked in over 87
                million minutes of viewership in the year 2020 alone, according to a report by market intelligence firm Nielsen. 
                So what is inspiring us to keep hitting the play button on stories that we have adequately memorised by now? 
                The experts believe that there could be a deeper psychological phenomenon at play.

           <h3>Rinse and repeat</h3>
        </font>

        “Uncertainty is anxiety’s fuel,” says Lucy Spicer, a London-based psychological coach. She further explains, “A lot of anxious thoughts are future-focused and the pandemic brought a significant lack of control over what the future would look like. Given this backdrop, it is unsurprising that we looked for security, familiarity and routine in our everyday lives to gain a sense of control. Sameness and repetition can help reduce anxiety as we can have an existing knowledge of how things are likely to be and, in turn, dial back uncertainty and worry. We can watch what we know over and over again without any surprises,
        thereby giving us the control and predictability we need in an unpredictable global situation.”
        <br>
        The sentiment is echoed by Tanya Percy Vasunia, a Mumbai-based psychologist and published researcher, who describes the phenomenon as a method for self-soothing during uncertain times—almost like catching up with long-lost friends. She says, “When you know what’s going to happen, it can be extremely soothing. Using your favourite TV shows as an escape is a relaxing exercise because these characters are dear to you.” She also believes that the iconic catchphrases that these shows spawn can serve as a form of self-expression. “People who struggle with expressing themselves often tend to take on characteristics from the characters they love—for instance, when someone says, ‘Joey doesn’t share food’ when talking about their habits or ‘May I interest you in a sarcastic comment?’ like Chandler Bing. 
        These small mechanisms can help you express emotions that have previously been difficult to express,” she says.

        So if you find yourself hitting play on a Brooklyn Nine Nine rerun over Zack Synder’s newest zombie heist caper, Spicer believes it is because it’s far less cognitively demanding to watch something we are familiar with than to watch something for the first time. She further links the phenomenon to the popular paradox of choice theory founded by psychologist Barry Schwartz. “When presented with multiple choices, it can overwhelm the brain and as a result, we are most likely to make no choice at all or to choose something that is safe and familiar,
        like your favourite TV series,” she explains.

            <h4>The era of reboots: Why nostalgia sells</h4>
        </font>
      <font size=5 face='georgia' color=black>
        When future generations look at the marquee listing for 2021, they might have cause to believe that the world was stuck in a time warp, of sorts. Let’s examine the proof: Cruella de Vil of 101 Dalmatians has her own origin story, Gossip Girl has gotten an inclusive and queer-friendly reboot and there’s a Legally Blonde reunion to look forward to. If studios and streaming algorithms are leaning in favour of revisiting the past, it is because the path is being dictated by the nostalgia-tinted lens of audience trends. After all, certain episodes can often serve as a time capsule back to happier times or fond memories from a particular phase of life—and this is precisely what has made reruns higher in demand during the pandemic. 
        <br> 
        For those willing to delve further into neuroscience, nostalgia is the link between stored memories in the brain and 
        emotions, says Spicer. “The neural activity activated by rewatching a TV show that we like causes the release of feel-good chemicals, like dopamine, and we are left with that warm, soothing feeling in our bodies. Our brains like to make paired associations, which means that when you watch something specific, it can remind you of a particularly happy time in your life and re-evoke some of the happy emotions you felt at that point,” she explains. It comes as little surprise then that nostalgia has translated into the low-maintenance escapism that we have been craving during the pandemic.
        <br>
        The trend has been further accelerated by the fact that many of us aren’t ready to watch our new 
        reality play out on our TV screens yet, believes Vasunia. “Many ongoing shows, such as Grey’s Anatomy, have started adapting their plot lines to depict the pandemic, and this can be incredibly triggering for some people. By comparison, watching old shows set in the pre-COVID world makes us feel safer and reminds us of a time before the pandemic because we seek comfort in what we already know and what’s familiar,” she elaborates. Indeed, the psychological payoff of watching reruns finds use in her everyday practice as well. “I often ask clients who struggle with sleep to rewatch a show they’ve already seen before because this allows you to get in a relaxed state and not take in any new information just before going to sleep. 
        In my experience with my clients, watching reruns has become a popular coping mechanism during the pandemic,” she concludes.
