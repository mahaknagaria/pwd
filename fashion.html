    If you’re up to date with the latest hit television series, Samantha Akkineni, seen in season two of Amazon Prime Video's The Family Man, will be a name that will instantly grab your attention. Just like her on-camera presence, her fashion choices too have left viewers on the edge of their seat. 
    Akkineni, who is set to star in the upcoming film Shaakuntalam, proves that she likes to make a statement in her roles as well as with her clothes. Her wardrobe is populated with statement outfits, bold prints and bright colours. She’s also shown a preference for dramatic silhouettes from seasoned labels like Isabel Marant and Alexander Wang, alongside sophisticated traditional numbers like white gossamer saris. To demonstrate her drama-loving sartorial sensibilities, we found some of Akkineni’s most memorable outfits that will make you a fan, if you weren't one already.

    <h3>Try a textural overload with satin and fringe</h3>
    The Tamil actor wears a sage green Kendra Duplantier fringe-hemmed slip dress. Consider it the prime vision board for an at-home wine-and-dine get-together, followed by some dancing that the dress simply calls for. 
    <h4>A white sheer sari stands the test of time </h4>
    For the promotion of her upcoming film Shaakuntalam, Akkineni wears a white Chanderi sari with delicate embroidery and a blouse featuring chikankari and embellished scallops from the label House of Three. The dreamy details are paired with traditional pearl earrings and a neat up-do woven with white roses and baby’s breath. It encapsulates how to sport a classic silhouette for a dressy occasion on a hot day.
